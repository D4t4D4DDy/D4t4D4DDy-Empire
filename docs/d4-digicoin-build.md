# ⚙️ D4-DigiCoin Build (Open for Contributors)  

## What This Doc Is  
This document describes the **technical, design, and ecosystem tasks** for contributors to help build D4-DigiCoin.

- 💻 **Smart Contract Code** → implement token standard (ERC-20 / similar).  
- 🔐 **Security** → audits, testing, anti-exploit protections.  
- 📊 **Tools** → explorers, dashboards, wallet integrations.  
- 🎨 **Branding** → logo, coin art, marketing visuals.  
- 🤖 **Avatar Integration** → ensure personal AI agents can earn/spend in D4-DigiCoin.  
- 🌍 **Ecosystem** → marketplaces, staking, P2P trades, cross-chain bridges.

2. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.  
3. Add or improve code/docs/designs.

- If a proposal conflicts with the vision doc, it will not be merged.  
- Contributions are welcomed in code, design, security, docs, and ecosystem tools.
